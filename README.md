# Special-Topics-Lab-3
The 3rd lab from my Special Topics in Programming course. The purpose of this lab was primarily to practice building static, shared, and dynamic libraries. The C language was used for this lab. The A option lab uses a dynamic library, the B option uses a shared library, and the C option uses a static library.
